# LRSFN_Optimization
#### Mini-Project for the Optimization for Machine Learning course, by Alessandro Fornaroli, Amos Gerber, Sergei Kliavinek

This repository contains three main iPython notebooks, each containing one of the three experiments that we carried (the Digit Classification experiment and two variations of the XOR experiment).
All the experiments are independent from each other, and therefore the notebooks can be executed in any order. 


## Digit_Classification.ipynb
This files contains the experiment for Digit Classification. 


## XOR_Simple.ipynb
This notebook illustrates the simple XOR classification experiment


## XOR_Continuous.ipynb
This notebook includes the continuous XOR experiment.

## Utils_xor.py

This file contains some utility and training functions that have been used for the XOR experiment.
